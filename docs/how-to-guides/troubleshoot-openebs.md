## Introduction

This guide enlists various issues with OpenEBS and steps to mitigate those problems.

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster accessible via `kubectl`.

* [OpenEBS component](../../configuration-reference/components/openebs-operator) installed.

## ISCSI volume mount issue

If you are running Flatcar version `2605.9.0` and deploy OpenEBS with version `0.5.0` of Lokoctl,
you might run into volume mount issue. The pod trying to mount the volume continues to stay in
`ContainerCreating` state. To fix this issue follow the following steps. This volume mount issue is
fixed in [this PR](https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive/pull/1266) in Lokomotive and is release as
a part of `0.6.0`. The nodes deployed using lokoctl version 0.5.0 or before need to do following
fix.

### Step 1: Fix the self-hosted Kubelet

> **NOTE**: If any of the following commands fail then you might not be running a self-hosted
> Kubelet in your cluster.

#### Step 1.1: Update the image

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system set image ds kubelet kubelet=quay.io/kinvolk/kubelet:v1.19.4
```

#### Step 1.2: Remove the iscsi mount

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system edit ds kubelet
```

Remove the following snippet from the kubelet Daemonset configuration:

```yaml
- mountPath: /usr/sbin/iscsiadm
  name: iscsiadm
```

### Step 2: Fix the iscsid service on hosts

SSH into all the worker nodes that will try to mount the volume created by OpenEBS. Run the
following set of commands to fix the `iscsid` service.

Acquire root credentials:

```bash
sudo -i
```

Create the `iscsid` service dropin and restart the service with new config, copy paste the following commands:

```bash
mkdir /run/systemd/system/iscsid.service.d
cat <<EOF > /run/systemd/system/iscsid.service.d/00-iscsid.conf
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'echo "InitiatorName=$(/sbin/iscsi-iname -p iqn.2020-01.io.kinvolk:01)" > /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi'
EOF
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart iscsid
systemctl status --no-page iscsid
journalctl --no-pager -u iscsid
```

### Step 3: Fix the bootstrap kubelet

Remove all the occurrences of `iscsiadm` from kubelet service file:

```bash
sed -i '/iscsiadm/d' /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
```

Restart kubelet process:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet
systemctl status --no-page kubelet
journalctl --no-pager -u kubelet
```

### Step 4: Verify the stuck pod

Check if the pod stuck in `ContainerCreating` state is in `Running` state now.
